indent is a program to format C and C++ code.  Via command-line switches
or options stored in a profile you get a lot of control over the way
the code is formatted.

Source code only is provided.  Use the shar program previously uploaded
to this system to unpack the shell archives into their component files.

	shar -u indent1
	shar -u indent2
	shar -u indent3

Everything finishes up in the same directory.  Run your favourite "make"
utility using one of the makefiles provided.

	makefile.cs2		is for IBM C Set/2
	makefile.20		is for the Microsoft C386 compiler
	makefile.1x		is for Microsoft C 6.0

The last of these will generate a bound executable which will run under
real MSDOS as well as in a DOS session under OS/2.
