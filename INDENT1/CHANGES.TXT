Changes made to indent to make it work with MS-Dos:

  Shortened file names.

  Changed makefile to work with ndmake

  #ifdef around include of <sys/param.h>.  This does not exist for
  MSC system, so I put what is needed in MSDOS.H

  Integrated my "config.h" and "typedefs.h" routines to try to back
  away from machine and compiler dependencies.

  Changed definition of allcaps in the "struct fstate" definition to
  be a "bit" (from "typedefs.h").

  Changed all "blanklines" (plural)  to "bl" to shorten variable names

  Changed all "blankline" (singular) to "bl" to shorten variable names

  Changed all "_declarations" to "dcl" to shorten variable names

  Declared the "msg" parameter on the diag() routine in io.c to keep
    parameter checking in MSC happy.

  Added -tabs switch to args.c table.

  Changed "tabsize" to be an integer rather than a #define.

  Deleted tabmask and replaced with computations involving tabsize.

  Added PROFILE_NAME to globs.h.  This names the indent profile file
  (which differs from MS-Dos to unix).

  Changed the way set_profile (args.c) looked for the profile file. 
  Now if the HOME environment is not defined it looks in root.

  Fixed problem in indent.c in which it became confused as to what
  was or was not a comment.  This was do to a bad test on sc_end.
