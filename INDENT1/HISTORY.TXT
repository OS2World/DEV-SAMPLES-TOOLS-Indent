	Fixed handling of non-standard tab sizes.  This affected
	mostly the way comments were formated.  Also changed
	to compile with the Large model - no reason
	other than I compile all my C programs this way.

	This is not an exact sibling of Bruce's Oct 25 version,
	I had already made most of these fixes when I got
	his updates.  I have verified there are no collisions
	and merged his all of his changes except the stack overflow
	fix which I perferred to fix by just linking with a bigger
	stack.

	The file "files.dif" contains a listing of the differences
	between this version and Bruce's Oct 25 version.

	Since all I have is Microsoft make...
	The command line "make indent.mak > make.err" was used
	to compile with Microsoft make and MSC version 5.1.

	Fixed stack overflow problem (again).  This time incorporated
	Charles Fleisher's fix, which is to malloc() a buffer in the
	bakcopy() routine rather than to have it allocated on the
	stack.

	Increased code, label, comment, and token buffer sizes.
	Indent can now indent itself!


August 2, 1989		Bruce A. Mallett
	Fixed stack overflow problem (reported by Charles Fleisher)
	by allocating a 12kb stack via a linker switch in makefile.

	Fixed creation of backup file.  It was just appending a
	".BAK" extension.  For MS-Dos it will now substitute the
	current extension with ".BAK".

Made changes to indent to make it work with MS-Dos:

  Shortened file names.

  Changed makefile to work with ndmake

  #ifdef around include of <sys/param.h>.  This does not exist for
  MSC system, so I put what is needed in MSDOS.H

  Integrated my "config.h" and "typedefs.h" routines to try to back
  away from machine and compiler dependencies.

  Changed definition of allcaps in the "struct fstate" definition to
  be a "bit" (from "typedefs.h").

  Changed all "blanklines" (plural)  to "bl" to shorten variable names

  Changed all "blankline" (singular) to "bl" to shorten variable names

  Changed all "_declarations" to "dcl" to shorten variable names

  Declared the "msg" parameter on the diag() routine in io.c to keep
    parameter checking in MSC happy.

  Added -tabs switch to args.c table.

  Changed "tabsize" to be an integer rather than a #define.

  Deleted tabmask and replaced with computations involving tabsize.

  Added PROFILE_NAME to globs.h.  This names the indent profile file
  (which differs from MS-Dos to unix).

  Changed the way set_profile (args.c) looked for the profile file. 
  Now if the HOME environment is not defined it looks in root.

  Fixed problem in indent.c in which it became confused as to what
  was or was not a comment.  This was do to a bad test on sc_end.
